# Embedded Drivers Learning Repository

🚧 Status: In Progress — currently learning bare-metal driver development for ESP32/STM32.

This repository will track my journey implementing low-level MCU drivers without using HAL:
- UART (TX/RX)
- SPI Master
- I2C (bit-banging + peripheral)

## 📂 Project Structure (will grow over time)
/src — driver source files  
/docs — notes, register maps, design decisions  

## 🧰 Tech Used
C, ESP-IDF, STM32 low-level programming, MCU registers  

---

## 📅 Learning Roadmap
- Week 1: UART driver (polling + interrupt)
- Week 2: SPI master driver
- Week 3: I2C bit-banging + peripheral mode
- Week 4: Documentation, timing diagrams, and cleanup

## 📊 Current Status
- Repository initialized
- Studying ESP32/STM32 register maps
- UART TX driver implementation starts next
